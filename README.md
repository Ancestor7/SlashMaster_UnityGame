# SlashMaster

Slash Master is an endless dungeon crawler mobile game where players traverse rooms filled with monsters and loot. To defeat the monsters, players must draw random shapes that appear on the screen. The game challenges players' speed and accuracy, as taking too long to defeat a monster would not be helpful for your health bar.

## About

This is my first game project. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

## Gameplay

- **Dungeon Exploration**: Traverse through rooms in a line endlessly. Each room can contain:
  - **Monster**: Draw random shapes to defeat them. Time-based attacks cause damage if players take too long.
  - **Merchant**: Buy and sell items to aid your journey.
  - **Resting Area**: Regain health and take a breather before venturing for the next rooms.
  - **Chest**: Find valuable items and equipment.
  - **Boss Monster**: Face tougher challenges with higher rewards.

## Features

- **Shape Drawing Combat**: (WIP) Defeat monsters by quickly drawing shapes that appear on the screen.
- **Endless Rooms**: The dungeon is endless, providing infinite gameplay.
- **Leader Boards**: (TBA) Race against other players for a high spot on the list.
- **Varied Encounters**: (TBA) Each room presents a different challenge or opportunity.
- **Health and Damage System**: (WIP) Manage your health carefully, as taking too long to draw shapes results in damage from monster attacks.
- **Items and Equipment**: (TBA) Collect items and gear to help you progress further into the dungeon.
